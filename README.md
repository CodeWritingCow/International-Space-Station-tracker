# International Space Station tracker

This Node.js app tracks the distance between the International Space Station (ISS) and our location on Earth in real time. (Location is currently set to New York, NY.) It logs data into a CSV file. It runs on the [Open Notify API](http://open-notify.org) by Nathan Bergey that retrieves raw data from NASA.

From the tutorials ["Node.js IoT: Tracking the ISS through the Sky,"](http://thisdavej.com/node-js-iot-tracking-the-iss-through-the-sky) and ["Node.js IoT: Logging Data That Is Out of This World"](http://thisdavej.com/node-js-iot-logging-data-that-is-out-of-this-world/) by Dave Johnson.
